# Gate

> A simple 2D platformer inspired by portal. You play as a poor man who only wishes that he could have a nice gaming rig. His desire gave birth to the thought of stealing his boss's beast pc with an RTX 8090. Since the boss's lair is so difficult to breach, all hope was almost lost, but fortunately your long time partner in crime Bob comes to the rescue with a hand-held portal device.
